Red Hat versioning is used with container images that are maintained by Red Hat.

Red Hat version definitions follow this pattern:

- the version of the main component, where major is required, but minor and patch are optional
- optionally a hyphen followed by release information
- the version of Red Hat's release as an integer, optionally followed by a timestamp like: `insert example`

Examples of valid Red hat versions:

- Simple example goes here
- Example with major, minor, patch, hypen and timestamp goes here

Ranges are not supported by this versioning.
